# Lattice Boltzmann Method

This code simulates D2Q9 (two dimension with nine velocities) Lattice Boltzmann fluid flow on two dimensional square lattice in the presence of circular/rectangular obstacle. Initial drift is set along positive x direction. Colorplot of vorticity is also attached for both circular and rectangular obstacles. Karman vortices are 
being observed in the attached plots. We have used reflecting/bounce-back boundary conditions while encountering with solid surfaces. In the attached plots
periodic boundary conditions are applied along both x and y directions. The code also has the facility of switching to reflecting-y boundary conditions. Using
gnuplot pipe live visualisation of different system variables (velocity and vorticlty) are possible.
