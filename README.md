# Lattice Boltzmann Method

This code simulates D2Q9 Lattice Boltzmann fluid flow on two dimensional square lattice in the presence of circular/rectangular obstacle. 
Initial drift is set along positive x direction. Colorplot of vorticity is also attached for both circular and rectangular obstacles. Karman vortices are 
being observed in the attached plots.
